Abstract = {The ability to exert real-time, adaptive control of transportation processes is the core of many intelligent transportation systems decision support tools. Reinforcement learning, an artificial intelligence approach undergoing development in the machine-learning community, offers key advantages in this regard. The ability of a control agent to learn relationships between control actions and their effect on the environment while pursuing a goal is a distinct improvement over prespecified models of the environment. Prespecified models are a prerequisite of conventional control methods and their accuracy limits the performance of control agents. This paper contains an introduction to Q-learning, a simple yet powerful reinforcement learning algorithm, and presents a case study involving application to traffic signal control. Encouraging results of the application to an isolated traffic signal, particularly under variable traffic conditions, are presented. A broader research effort is outl},

abstract={Traffic congestion has become a vexing and complex issue in many urban areas. Of particular interest are the intersections where traffic bottlenecks are known to occur despite being traditionally signalized. Reinforcement learning (RL), which is an artificial intelligence approach, has been adopted in traffic signal control for monitoring and ameliorating traffic congestion. RL enables autonomous decision makers (e.g., traffic signal controllers) to observe, learn, and select the optimal action (e.g., determining the appropriate traffic phase and its timing) to manage traffic such that system performance is improved. This article reviews various RL models and algorithms applied to traffic signal control in the aspects of the representations of the RL model (i.e., state, action, and reward), performance measures, and complexity to establish a foundation for further investigation in this research field. Open issues are presented toward the end of this article to discover new research areas with the objective to spark new interest in this research field.},
